HIR/LIR todos:
* Resolve data flow:
  * Create movement instructions on intervals' edges
  * Create movement instructions for phis
* Replace intervals in instructions with registers

* Move context variables get/set to instructions (with index as imm arg)
  (No values for them, as they may be changed by side-effect instructions)
* Vararg arguments (call)
* Speeding up HIR construction
* Cleanup masm
* Cleanup stubs

Postponed todos (old):
* a && b (b should not be executed)
* Tail-call elimination
* On-stack replacement and profile-based optimizations (register allocation too)
* Incremental GC
* Usage in multiple-threads (aka isolates)
* gdbjit
* Ast node ids
* Dtrace :)
